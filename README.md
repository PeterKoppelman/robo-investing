# robo-investing
Create a robo investing system

This is the capstone project for the Python diploma at NYU that Michael Shore and I will be doing. The following are high level bullet points for the project:

1)Identify data entry items that are needed to create a robo investing tool,
2) Determine where to get historical market date from (quandl? IEX?)
3) Create portfolio models based on a) age, b) gender, c) marital status, d) aversion to risk. maybe more...
4) The system may or may not model liquid and retirement portfolios differently.
5) Create a dashboard for output that will allow the client to change input items and see how the portfolio changes.

The securities that the system will use to create the portfolios will be limited to mutual funds and ETFs.
The system will be based on robo investing portfolios from large mutual fund companies such as Schwab and Fidelity.
